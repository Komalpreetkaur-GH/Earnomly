## Overview

Earnomly is an interactive web application that provides comprehensive analysis of socioeconomic factors affecting income levels. It combines exploratory data analysis with machine learning models to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K annually.

## Features

### Data Overview
- Dataset statistics and sample data viewer
- Data quality metrics with missing value analysis
- Interactive data exploration

### Data Analysis (EDA)
- Income distribution visualization
- Age vs Income correlation analysis
- Interactive correlation heatmaps
- Workclass distribution charts

### Supervised Learning
- **Random Forest Classifier** - Ensemble learning with configurable trees (50-300) and depth
- **Logistic Regression** - Linear classification with regularization tuning
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion matrix visualization

### Unsupervised Learning
- **K-Means Clustering** - Pattern discovery with configurable clusters (2-10)
- **PCA Visualization** - Dimensionality reduction with explained variance ratio
- Elbow method for optimal cluster selection

### Income Predictor
- Real-time income prediction based on user inputs
- Visual confidence scores with probability gauges
- Premium result display with gradient styling

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit with custom CSS
- **Visualization**: Plotly Express
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
